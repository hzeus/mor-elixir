= MOR - Elixir

This is the code of my talk about Elixir at Monster On Rails on 2013-09-25. It is (nearly completely) based on the [talk of Dave Thomas](http://youtu.be/KQwEmdOH-GM).

During my presentation I've used a mixture of [git-presenter](https://github.com/pythonandchips/git-presenter) and [guard-shell](https://github.com/guard/guard-shell).
